Spoilers/Tips for Later Levels
<details>
  <summary>Level 1</summary>
  The Fairy Queen has two attacks: one where she lays mines of light and a melee attack.
  
  - The mines only deal damage when they explode, so keep strafing to avoid them!
  - The melee attack is hard to dodge, and will chip you down. Maintain combo to outDamage the boss!

  <summary>Level 2</summary>
  The Crystal Tiger has two attacks: summoning crystal pillars, and a shard attack.
  
  - The shard will always burst a set distance from the tiger. Observe this distance to avoid taking damage from the fragments.
  - The boss is committed after they summon the first pillar. After dodging, dash in for a melee attack to deal heavy damage.

  <summary>Level 3</summary>
  The dragon has a lot of hp, so you can't kill it directly. You need to build up your super attack to damage it.
     
  - Kill the dwarves to collect their soul energy while dodging the boss, then use the super to strike back!
  - You can collateral more dwarves with the blast to get some free souls/heart drops
  - Try and avoid picking up hearts if you are at full hp to save them for later
  
  The Dragon has 3 attacks: Flame breath, a dash attack, and a stomp.
  - The flame breath can be dogded by strafing since it has a long charge time
  - The dash is hard to dodge. Keep killing dwarves to get heart drops and recover the damage
  - Avoid getting close to the dragon, since the stomp has a short range. It does the most damage of all the attacks.
